<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the starter for the Flask React Project. 

1. Clone the repository

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/lamarjd/Dont-Forget-The-Milk
 ```

## Available Scripts

Before starting with the next steps, ensure you cd in to the app (backend) directory to make sure you have base dependencies for running this app.

=================================================

2. Install dependencies (Backend / Flask)

```bash
  pipenv install -r requirements.txt
  ```

To generate a new requirements.txt run this command

```bash
 pipenv requirements > requirements.txt
 ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment

4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file

5. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app
   
```bash
 pipenv shell 
 ```
   
```bash
 flask db upgrade
 ```
   
```bash
 flask seed all 
 ```
   
```bash
 flask run 
 ```

6. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.

Before starting with the next steps, ensure you cd in to the react-app directory to make sure you have base dependencies for running this app.

=================================================

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
 npm install
 ```

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
 npm start
 ```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
